# Shortcut-Utilities
#### Create environmental variables, symlinks, shortcuts and file copies in a step by step manner

## Description

This script lets you create permanent environmental variables, shortcuts, symlinks and file copies guiding you through all the process with simple prompts to fill in to create the things mentioned above.

If you are a more advanced user maybe this is not for you, but this script was made a side project for achieving some specific needs that I have had in the past when I did not know all the commands that my needs require.

So, if you are begining with Powershell and you want to create some of the things proposed here without having to research for all the commands to do it, you can use this script. Also take a look at the script to enter yourself at the *powershell scripting* world. 

And if you are a little bit more advanced, maybe the funtionality of creating multiple things without having to reenter the same command with a new path and same destination multiple times might like you of this script.

### How to run it

Make sure your system has permission for running scripts.
Enter this in your powershell terminal.

**Running process**
1. Download the powershell script into your system.
2. In a powershell terminal, `cd` into the script directory.
