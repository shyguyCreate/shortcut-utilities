# Shortcut-Utilities
#### Create environmental variables, symlinks, shortcuts and file copies in a step by step manner

## Description

This script lets you create permanent environmental variables, shortcuts, symlinks and file copies guiding you through all the process with simple prompts to fill in to create the things mentioned above.

I know that things like copying files get easier as you began understanding the commands and environmental variables are not far from understanding than a single browser check. But things like symlinks that for some reason can not be passed multiple files so you will end up typing the same command multiple times, is painful. And don't get me started with shortcuts, because they are not comfortable in command line, is much quicker through a GUI.

So, if you are begining with Powershell or you are a more advanced user, and you want to create  multiple things proposed here without having to reenter the same command with a new path and same destination over and over again or you don't want to memorize a command with a bunch of switches and properties, this script might be for you.
