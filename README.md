# Shortcut-Utilities
#### Create environmental variables, symlinks, shortcuts and file copies in a step by step manner

## Description

This script lets you create permanent environmental variables, shortcuts, symlinks and file copies guiding you through all the process with simple prompts to fill in to create the things mentioned above.

I know that things like copying files are easy if you know the command and environmental variables are not far from understanding than a single browser check. But things like symlinks that do not allow you to make more than one at a time, will require you to retype the same command, which is time consuming. And shortcuts are painful and not comfortable in command line, is quicker through a GUI.

So, if you are a Powershell beginner or a more advanced user, and you want to create multiple things proposed here without having to reenter the same command with a new path and same destination over and over again or you don't want to memorize a command with a bunch of switches and properties, this script might be for you.
